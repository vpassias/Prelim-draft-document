\title{Prelim Questions.}
\maketitle

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Do topological/non-topological materials in heterostructures composed of Na$_{3}$Bi determine whether there are topological surface states at the interface?

    \item What is the fate of interface states in heterostructures composed of Na$_{3}$Bi and other non-topological/topological materials?

    \item At the interface of Na$_{3}$Bi and a topological/non-topological material, can we realize topological states?
    
    \item Do heterostructures composed of Na$_{3}$Bi and a topological/non-topological material preserve or destroy Fermi arcs on Na$_{3}$Bi surfaces that have Fermi arcs?

    \item Do Fermi arc states of Weyl semimetals, such as TaAs, and topological Dirac semimetals, such as Na$_{3}$Bi, hybridize at the interface of a heterostructure composed of the two materials? If they do hybridize, is the the resultant state localized on the interface? Does this depend
    on the orientation of Na$_{3}$Bi ? Are these interface states topological?

    \item In a ferromagnetic metal/Na$_{3}$Bi heterostructure, what effect do the Fermi arc states have on the net magnetization of the heterostructure?

    \item Does the absence of Fermi arc states on the Na$_{3}$Bi (001) plane prohibit the formation of topological states in a heterostructure of Na$_{3}$Bi and a topological/non-topological material?

    \item Can we find states localized at the interface of Na$_{3}$Bi (001) and a topological/non-topological material? If we have a Weyl semimetal on Na$_{3}$Bi (001), do the Fermi arc states of the former terminate at the interface or do they penetrate into the bulk of both materials?

    \item Does the degree of localization of states at the interface of Na$_{3}$Bi and a topological/non-topological material depend on the orientation of Na$_{3}$Bi?

    \item Does the degree of localization of the interface states, if they exist, of a heterosturcture of a topological material and Na$_{3}$Bi depend on whether we have a topological insulator or Weyl semimetal?
