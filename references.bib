	abstract = {Topological insulators are electronic materials that have a bulk band gap like an ordinary insulator but have protected conducting states on their edge or surface. These states are possible due to the combination of spin-orbit interactions and time-reversal symmetry. The two-dimensional (2D) topological insulator is a quantum spin Hall insulator, which is a close cousin of the integer quantum Hall state. A three-dimensional (3D) topological insulator supports novel spin-polarized 2D Dirac fermions on its surface. In this Colloquium the theoretical foundation for topological insulators and superconductors is reviewed and recent experiments are described in which the signatures of topological insulators have been observed. Transport experiments on HgTe∕CdTe quantum wells are described that demonstrate the existence of the edge states predicted for the quantum spin Hall insulator. Experiments on Bi1−xSbx, Bi2Se3, Bi2Te3, and Sb2Te3 are then discussed that establish these materials as 3D topological insulators and directly probe the topology of their surface states. Exotic states are described that can occur at the surface of a 3D topological insulator due to an induced energy gap. A magnetic gap leads to a novel quantum Hall state that gives rise to a topological magnetoelectric effect. A superconducting energy gap leads to a state that supports Majorana fermions and may provide a new venue for realizing proposals for topological quantum computation. Prospects for observing these exotic states are also discussed, as well as other potential device applications of topological insulators.},

	abstract = {Topological insulators are new states of quantum matter which cannot be adiabatically connected to conventional insulators and semiconductors. They are characterized by a full insulating gap in the bulk and gapless edge or surface states which are protected by time-reversal symmetry. These topological materials have been theoretically predicted and experimentally observed in a variety of systems, including HgTe quantum wells, BiSb alloys, and Bi2Te3 and Bi2Se3 crystals. Theoretical models, materials properties, and experimental results on two-dimensional and three-dimensional topological insulators are reviewed, and both the topological band theory and the topological field theory are discussed. Topological superconductors have a full pairing gap in the bulk and gapless surface states consisting of Majorana fermions. The theory of topological superconductors is reviewed, in close analogy to the theory of topological insulators.},

	url = {https://www.annualreviews.org/doi/10.1146/annurev-matsci-070218-010049},
	abstract = {We review recent theoretical progress in the understanding and prediction of novel topological semimetals. Topological semimetals define a class of gapless electronic phases exhibiting topologically stable crossings of energy bands. Different types of topological semimetals can be distinguished on the basis of the degeneracy of the band crossings, their codimension (e.g., point or line nodes), and the crystal space group symmetries on which the protection of stable band crossings relies. The dispersion near the band crossing is a further discriminating characteristic. These properties give rise to a wide range of distinct semimetal phases such as Dirac or Weyl semimetals, point or line node semimetals, and type I or type II semimetals. In this review we give a general description of various families of topological semimetals, with an emphasis on proposed material realizations from first-principles calculations. The conceptual framework for studying topological gapless electronic phases is reviewed, with a particular focus on the symmetry requirements of energy band crossings, and the relation between the different families of topological semimetals is elucidated. In addition to the paradigmatic Dirac and Weyl semimetals, we pay particular attention to more recent examples of topological semimetals, which include nodal line semimetals, multifold fermion semimetals, and triple-point semimetals. Less emphasis is placed on their surface state properties, their responses to external probes, and recent experimental developments.},

	abstract = {The recent discovery of Dirac semimetals represents a new achievement in our fundamental understanding of topological states of matter. Due to their topological surface states, high mobility, and exotic properties associated with bulk Dirac points, these new materials have attracted significant attention and are believed to hold great promise for fabricating novel topological devices. For nanoscale device applications, effects from finite size usually play an important role. In this report, we theoretically investigate the electronic properties of Dirac semimetal nanostructures. Quantum confinement generally opens a bulk band gap at the Dirac points. We find that confinement along different directions shows strong anisotropic effects. In particular, the gap due to confinement along vertical c-axis shows a periodic modulation, which is absent for confinement along horizontal directions. We demonstrate that the topological surface states could be controlled by lateral electrostatic gating. It is possible to generate Rashba-like spin splitting for the surface states and to shift them relative to the confinement-induced bulk gap. These results will not only facilitate our fundamental understanding of Dirac semimetal nanostructures, but also provide useful guidance for designing all-electrical topological spintronics devices.},

	doi = {10.1073/pnas.1524787113},
	abstract = {In recent years there has been a surge of interest in quantum materials with topologically protected properties that are robust against the effects of disorder and other perturbations. An interesting example is the newly discovered three-dimensional analog of graphene, called Dirac semimetals. These were expected to have highly unusual conducting states on their surfaces. We show here that the surface states of Dirac semimetals do not exhibit the expected topological robustness and, quite generally, get deformed into states that are of a rather different character. Our theoretical results not only have conceptual importance in the field of topological quantum materials but also make clear predictions that can be tested in several experiments.Motivated by recent experiments probing anomalous surface states of Dirac semimetals (DSMs) Na3Bi and Cd3As2, we raise the question posed in the title. We find that, in marked contrast to Weyl semimetals, the gapless surface states of DSMs are not topologically protected in general, except on time-reversal-invariant planes of surface Brillouin zone. We first demonstrate this finding in a minimal four-band model with a pair of Dirac nodes at k=(0,0,±Q), where gapless states on the side surfaces are protected only near kz=0. We then validate our conclusions about the absence of a topological invariant protecting double Fermi arcs in DSMs, using a K-theory analysis for space groups of Na3Bi and Cd3As2. Generically, the arcs deform into a Fermi pocket, similar to the surface states of a topological insulator, and this pocket can merge into the projection of bulk Dirac Fermi surfaces as the chemical potential is varied. We make sharp predictions for the doping dependence of the surface states of a DSM that can be tested by angle-resolved photoemission spectroscopy and quantum oscillation experiments.},
